# Vehicle Trajectory Data

## Collected from vehicle
### Uniform tools for data analysis
- [trajdata]((https://github.com/NVlabs/trajdata)). trajdata is developed by NVIDIA Research. It is a Python package for loading, processing, and visualizing vehicle trajectory data.
- [unitraj](https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj). UniTraj is developed by EPFL.

### Data from vehicle manufacturers
- [Waymo Open Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/). The Waymo Open Dataset is comprised of high-resolution sensor data collected by Waymo self-driving cars in a wide variety of conditions. It is one of the largest, richest, and most diverse self-driving datasets ever released for research.

### Data from experiments (GNSS)
- [OpenACC](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/9702c950-c80f-4d2f-982f-44d06ea0009f). Open Database of car-following experiments involving vehicles with Adaptive Cruise Control systems (ACC). The objective of the OpenACC Database is to provide data about ACC behavior to the whole scientific community in order to achieve a better understanding of the properties of ACC vehicles and to understand how their widespread may influence traffic dynamics in order to anticipate possible problems related to it.


## Collected from infrastructure
- [NGSIM](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm). The Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program is an effort to develop a new generation of traffic simulation models based on the collection of detailed vehicle trajectory data. The data was collected from US-101, I-80, and I-880 in California.
