Open Traffic Science is [scoped](https://www.opentraffic.science/scope) to open up the knowledge of traffic science to everyone, followded with open data, open tools, open tutorials, and open discussions.

> The problem of traffic flow, one of Society's major problems, is an ancient one that has been of great importance whenever men or goods have been moved from one place to another... Our specific objective was to see whether it was possible to develop broad generalizations and quantitative system theories that would explain various phenomena concerning the movement of vehicles controlled by human beings. - Robert Herman, 1960.

The origins of traffic science date back to 1950s, when pioneers like [Leslie C. Edie](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Edie-Leslie-C), [Robert Herman](https://www.nae.edu/188205/ROBERT-HERMAN-19141997), [Robert E. Chandler](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Robert-E.-Chandler), [Denos Gazis](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Gazis-Denos-C), [Elliott W. Montroll](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Montroll-Elliott-W), [Refrey B. Potts](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Potts-Renfrey-B), and [Richard W. Rothery](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Rothery-Richard-W) paved the way for this field. They conducted extensive field experiments, initiated the ISTTT symposium series, and authored several influential textbooks. 
<!-- Today, with the rise of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), along with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), traffic science can be revisited and enhanced through these emerging technologies. -->
