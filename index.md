The origins of traffic science date back to 1950s, when pioneers like [Leslie C. Edie](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Edie-Leslie-C), [Robert Herman](https://www.nae.edu/188205/ROBERT-HERMAN-19141997), [Robert E. Chandler](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Robert-E.-Chandler), [Denos Gazis](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Gazis-Denos-C), [Elliott W. Montroll](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Montroll-Elliott-W), [Refrey B. Potts](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Potts-Renfrey-B), and [Richard W. Rothery](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Rothery-Richard-W) paved the way for this field. They conducted extensive field experiments, initiated the ISTTT symposium series, and authored several influential textbooks. Today, with the rise of connected and automated vehicles, along with advancements in artificial intelligence, traffic science can be revisited and enhanced through these emerging technologies.
