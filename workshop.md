# Vehicle Trajectory Data Camp

The workshop attract more people than expected. Many of the participants shows interests to see another workshop on this topic next year.

## Panel discussion
1. Data quality is important, data standard might be the next step;
2. **Education** on the new data and new application in traffic and vehicle research and development;


## Other takeaway
- Tesla's safety feature is a critical point that the engine mode is totally different from the others.

## Follow-up actions
- Scope of the next workshop;
<!-- Xingmin would love to contribute to the idea of open traffic science and the fundamental problems. It's good. Since I have no idea what's the state of the art in urban traffic, it's a nice compensation. -->

## Notes to future
- Should consider setup note-takers for the workshop;

## Personal summary
- If there are no hard and dirty works done from the engineering side, it's impossible to have any scientific discovery.
