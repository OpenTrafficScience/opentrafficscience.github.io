## Background
Since the rise of big data and deep learning (starting around 2015), along with advancements in reinforcement learning (notably since AlphaGo) and large models (from 2022 onwards), transportation and traffic research has undergone significant transformations in various aspects. 

## Scope

The problems of transportation and traffic are very old ones.

Traffic science can be traced back to 1956. Leslie C. Edie, Robert Herman, Robert E. Chandler, Denos Gazis, Elliott W. Montroll, Refrey B. Potts, and Richard W. Rothery opened up this direction that time. They did huge amount of field-testing work, opening up the ISTTT symposium series, and write few fantastic textbooks. In the era of connected and automated vehicles and artificial intelligence, 

We plan to revisit traffic science with emerging technologies and open data.

We need to identify the **fundamental questions** in our research community. No matter how the technologies evolve, the **fundamental questions** remain consistent. The philosophy behind this initiative is to mentor the younger generation using first principle.

> The first principle is a foundational concept or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition and serves as the basic building block for understanding and reasoning.

For people with diverse backgrounds and purposes, we aim to create a "knowledge tree" that provides various learning paths, enabling personalized learning experiences.

As a textbook-style initiative, we would pay more attention to the scientific part, although we might be able to include more engineering details. Or, we should separate those tedious (although important) data processing with true science and knowledge. This is why we recognize ourselves as traffic scientists. 

## Plan

At the initial stage, Xingmin and Junyi could start from writing the main content at the beginning. Getting some senior advising professors to review the contents. Xingmin is familiar with urban traffic while Junyi is more familiar with freeway traffic. Topics like travel behavior and traffic planning are beyond the scope of the first iteration.

Scale up: once we have certain scale, we can start to advise and open to public. I think it might be a good idea to make it open in twofold: 1) accessible to everyone. 2) everyone can also contribute to it.

> Open Science: Making science more accessible, inclusive and equitable for the benefit of all.

Core value: Open knowledge to everyone, learn & contribute (issues & pull request)

Stage 1: online book and blogging

Stage 2: making it more iterative, like open-source community

## Main content

Online blogging (lecture)

1. Traffic measurement
2. Traffic model
    - First-order continuum traffic flow model (LWR model)
    - Numerical solutions of LWR model, Godunov scheme, CTM
3. Signalized intersections
    - Scientific merit in traffic signal control (what a researcher should know from MUCTD)
    - Probabilistic traffic flow model for signalized intersections
4. Data platform for connected vehicles trajectories in large-scale networks
